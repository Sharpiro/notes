## instruction overview

```asm
push 0x3938 ; push 8 byte value onto stack
push word 0x3938 ; push 2 byte value onto stack (no push byte & dword is still 8 bytes)
push r8w ; push 2 byte word from r8 onto stack
```

## string and length

```asm
section .data
    msg db `Hello, World!\n`
    msg_len equ $ - msg
```

## `jmp`

in some situations a jump needs to be calculated with (address - instruction_size) because after the jump is made, the instruction pointer will immediately be incremented, possibly moving 1 instruction passed the one you meant to execute next

### jmp - absolute

Will jump to instruction at `0x401020` as expected

```asm
jmp    0x401020
```

### jmp - register relative

Will jump to instruction at the dereference of `rsp+0x8` as expected

```asm
jmp    QWORD PTR [rsp+0x8]
```

### jmp - rip relative

seems to always be off by 6, implying the `rip` register is being incremented earlier than even gdb says.

gdb when at this instruction evaluates `rip+0x2fe2` to be `0x404012`, 6 bytes short of the `0x404018` address it will dereference then jump to.

```asm
jmp    QWORD PTR [rip+0x2fe2] # 0x404018 <printf@got.plt>
```

## compare and jump

`cmp` seems better to use that `test` since `test` does bitwise compares

```asm
    mov r9b, [rsi + r8]
    cmp r9b, 0x00
    jne seek_char ; jne == jnz
```

## labels

```asm
puts_func: ; global label
    mov rax, SYS_WRITE
.seek_char: ; local label
    add r8, 1
%endmacro
```

## Caller vs Callee registers

- Caller Registers (volatile)
    - caller must preserve these registers if used
    - rax, rdi, rsi, rdx
    - r8 - r11
    - ..more
- Callee registers (non-volatile)
    - callee must preserve these registers if used
    - rbp
    - r12 - r15
    - ..more

| Register     | **Windows x64 (MS ABI)** | **System V AMD64 (Linux/macOS ABI)** |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `rax`        | Volatile (return value)  | Volatile (return value)              |
| `rcx`        | Volatile (1st arg)       | Volatile (4th arg)                   |
| `rdx`        | Volatile (2nd arg)       | Volatile (3rd arg)                   |
| `r8`         | Volatile (3rd arg)       | Volatile (5th arg)                   |
| `r9`         | Volatile (4th arg)       | Volatile (6th arg)                   |
| `r10`, `r11` | Volatile (scratch)       | Volatile (scratch)                   |
| `rdi`        | Preserved (callee-saved) | Volatile (1st arg)                   |
| `rsi`        | Preserved (callee-saved) | Volatile (2nd arg)                   |
| `rbx`        | Preserved (callee-saved) | Preserved (callee-saved)             |
| `rbp`        | Preserved (callee-saved) | Preserved (callee-saved)             |
| `r12-r15`    | Preserved (callee-saved) | Preserved (callee-saved)             |

## C calling convention registers

- First six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers
    - `RDI`, `RSI`, `RDX`, `RCX`, `R8`, `R9`

## zero-extend

- Moves the lower 32 bits only of `rdi` into the 32 bit register `r8d`
- automatically zero-extends `r8d` clearing the upper 32 bits

```asm
mov r8d, edi
```

## position independent code (-fPIC)

- the `rel` keyword somehow makes this position-independent
- can be applied to whole program or to individual commands
- `rel` and `abs` can be used to override default setting

```asm
DEFAULT REL ; or ABS
```

```asm
lea rsi, [rel new_line]
```
